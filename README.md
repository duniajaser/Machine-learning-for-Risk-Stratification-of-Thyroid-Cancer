# Machine-learning-for-Risk-Stratification-of-Thyroid-Cancer
The aim of this assignment was to employ machine learning methods in order to predict the 
probability of relapse in those diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. To achieve 
this, we explored the application of various machine learning models, including k- nearest 
neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machines with a Soft margin, and Decision tree. These 
models were chosen for their potential to capture complex patterns in the data and make 
accurate predictions regarding cancer relapse.
